# Reproducible Figures and Science Communication - MT Assignment
This repo contains all the code and files for Q2 of this assignment, where I construct a data pipeline to investigate the relationship between flipper length and body mass within the PalmerPenguins dataset, for three different penguin species. I also investigate whether the species plays a role (species-specific interactions).

The aim of my code is for it to be reproducible and usable by anyone.

Code can be found in "Penguins_Project_Assignment.qmd", figures are in the "figures" folder, both datasets (raw/clean) are in "datasets" and novel function scripts are in "functions". 

To open, please download the repository and open the .Rproj file and .qmd file from there. 

To ensure your packages are up-to-date and compatible with my code, please use renv::restore in the console.

Thank you and enjoy!
